  chords: |
    My life is brilliant, my love is pure
    I saw an angel, of that I'm sure

    People killed and people dyin
    children hurt and hear them crying
    can you practise what you preach
    won't you turn the other cheek

    Forever young,
    I wanna be forever young

    I won't hesitate no more no more
    It cannot wait, I'm yours

    This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
    No love no hope to glory, no happy ending

    'Cause you are amazing
    Oh we did amazing things

    If I could, then I would
    I'll go wherever you will go

    Can you feel the love tonight

    And she will be loved,
    Yeah she will be loved.

    Oh take me home, country road,
    To the place where I belong

    And I wanna TV embrace

    I'm your biggest fan I follow you until you love me
    pappa papparazzi

    I can't live with or without you

    Whenever I fall at your feet
    You let your tears...

    Am I not pretty enough, is my heart too broken

    ----

    When I find myself in times of trouble,
    Mother Mary comes to me.

    I'm startin' with the man in the mirror

    Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner.

    That's the way it's gonna be little darlin
    You'll go ridin' on the horses yeah yeah

    No woman no cry

    Mama this surely is a dream

    I come from the land down under

    Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong

    Dinky di true blue, the funny things you do,
    Australia, Australia, this is you

    Taylor was a good girl, never want to be late,
    complain, express, ideas in her brain,

    I need some love like I never needed love before,
    Wanna make love to your baby

    Take on me, Take me out,
    I'll be gone, In a day...

    Save tonight, and find the break of dawn.
    Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone.

    Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.
    There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.

    I know she's playing with me.
    Well that's okay 'cause I got no self-esteem.

    With a thousand lies and a good disguise
    Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes

    In your head, in your head,
    Zombie, zombie, zombie

    It's too late too apologize.
    It's too late.

    Can't read my, can't read my
    No he can't read my poker face

    Come on Barbie let's go party

    I'm not here for your entertainment,
    You don't really want to mess with with me tonight

    Take your canvas bags, take your canvas bags
    Take your canvas bags to the supermarket

    SOLO

    Time to say goodbye

    Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
    And never brought to mind?

    I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane.
    I'm a birdplane. A mother fuckin' birdplane.

    Doesn't that sound familiar?
    Doesn't that hit too close to home?
    Doesn't that make you shiver,
    The way that things have gone?
    And doesn't that seem peculiar,
    'Cause everyone wants a little more?
    It's something I do remember
    to never go this far.
    That's all it takes to be a star.

                        G                    Bm
    You could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin
    G       Bm                    Em
      Or a cardboard stand-up and paint me (paint me)
        Bm                      D
    Any face that you wanted me To be seen. We're

    Am                                     Em
    Damned by the existential moment where We saw the couple in the coma and
    Bm                        D
    It was we were the clich�,  But we carried on anyway.

    Em                                   Em
    So, sure, I could just close my eyes. Yeah, sure, trace and memorize,
    D              D
    But can you go back once you know

    If I'm the person that you think I am
    C                          Bm      Em
    clueless chump you seem to think I am, so
           C                               Bm
    Easily led astray, an errant dog who occasionally escapes and
    Em
    needs a shorter leash then
    C                       Bm      D
     Why the f*ck would you want me back?  Maybe it's because....

    the first G of this starts with the word "because" ^^^

     What (What?)   I'm trying to tell you
         Em                 Bm

        Em                      C
    The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
          D               Asus4   Am
    Not a footprint to be seen
      Em            C
    A kingdom of isolation
           D                  Asus4    A
    And it looks like I'm the queen
                  Em          C                 D              Asus4    Am
    The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
    Em               D                     A
    Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried


    [Pre-Chorus]
    D                                 C
    Don't let them in, don't let them see
                                        D
    Be the good girl you always have to be
                                        C
    Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
                   Cadd2
    Well, now they know


    [Chorus]

    Turn away and slam the door
    G       Dsus4/F#          Em7      Cadd9
    I don't care what they're going to say

    The cold never bothered me anyway

    It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
            Em              D                   Asus4         A
    And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all


    [Pre-Chorus]

    D                            Cadd9
    It's time to see what I can do
                                 D
    To test the limits and break through
                                     Cadd9
    No right, no wrong, no rules for me
        Cadd2
    I'm free

    I am one with the wind and sky

    Let it go, let it go
          Em7              Cadd9
    You'll never see me cry
    G       Dsus4/F#          Em7      Cadd9
    Here I stand and here I'll stay

    My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

    And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

    I'm never going back, the past is in the past


    [Chorus]

    And I'll rise like the break of dawn

    E                         G#/D#
    This is the song for Phil Daoust
               C#m                C       B
    Occasional Guardian-newspaper Journal-oust
    E                 G#/D#
    I never-ever-ever mentioned your name
           C#m                         B
    Or the review you wrote when I was new to this game
    C#m                  G#/C
    But now the time has come
                 E/B                       F#/A#
    I think I've dealt with my feelings at last
         A
    I really wanna forgive you Phil, yeah
      E/G#
    I wanna leave the past in the past-oh-oh
             E            G#/D#
    And as this is London town
      C#m                              C   B
    I thought I ought to take the opportunity
                     E
    'Cause there's a pretty good chance
             G#/D#
    Somebody out there will know you
        C#m                       B
    And maybe they will pass on a message for me

    C#m                 G#/C
    Just wanna say Phil Daoust
               E/B                F#/A#
    Occasional Guardian-newspaper Journal-oust
              A
    That it's been three years since you wrote it
        E/G#
    And time is very healing
          A
    But I still wanna cut big chunks of flesh

    Out of your stupid face
        B (this chord continues until ding-dang)
    And make your children watch

    While I force you to eat them.


    I wanna make your children

    watch you eat your own face meat

    E         B
    Ding-dang ding-dang-dong
    C#m        G#m
    This is my Phil Daoust song
    A         E
    Everybody sing along
    A
    La-la-la-la-la-la
      B
    I hope one of your family members dies
    E     B
    Phil, ding-dang-dong
    C#m                   G#m
    I've written you this special song
       A                E
    To help you get the attention
        A          B            E
    You obviously, desperately, lack.

    G                        Am
    night paint your pallete blue and grey
                  C                D7                               G
    Look out on a summer's day with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
                                           Am
    Shadows on a hill sketch the tress and daffodils
                             C               D7                        G
    Catch the breeze and the winter chill in colors on the snowy linen land

    night flamings flowers that brightly blaze

    Swirling coulds of violet haze reflect in Vincents eyes of china blue
                                           Am
    Colors changing hue, morning fields of amber grays

    And when no hope was left in sight on that starry starry night

    You took you life as lovers often do But I could of told you Vincent
         C                                D7           G
    This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you


    Starry starry
    G                       Am
    night portraits hung in empty halls
                       C                   D7                                     G
    frameless heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
                                                          Am
    Like the strangers that you've met, the ragged men in ragged clothes
