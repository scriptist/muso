    | My Earth   and I | Live in it.  It's |


    | D                 | Dm6/F                     |
    | On third dirt and | two thirds water.  And it |

    | Rotates and revolves through space, at | rather an impressive pace, and |

    | D          G7           | A        |
    | Never even messes up my | hair. And |

    | F#m               F#m7             | B7sus4        B7                    |
    | Here's the really weird thing, the | force created by it's spin   is the |

    | D                   | A/C#           | E  \\  \\  Fdim7   |
    | Force that stop the | chaos flooding | in.      This is |

    | My earth,   and it's | fine.   It's |

    | Bm7    D           | A     F#m       |
    | Perfect   but it's | mine.  It's not |

    | D         | E             |
    | Perfect   |       This is |



    | A                    | E                 |
    | My country,    and I | live in it.  It's |

    | D              | Dm6/F                      |
    | Pretty big and | nice to walk on.   And the |

    | A                             | A7/C#                  |
    | Bloke who runs my country has | build a demagogery and |

    | D               G7          | A                |
    | Taught us to be fearful and | boring.  And the |

    | Weirdest thing is that he is   con | servative of politics,   but |

    | D             A/C#           | E  \\  \\   Fdim7   |
    | Really rather radical of eye | brows.    This is |

    | F#7sus4   F#m7         | D6    D      |
    | My country    and it's | fine.   It's |

    | My house    and I | live in it.   It's |

    | D                  | Dm6/F            |
    | Made of cracks and | photographs.  We |

    | Weirdest thing is that this house    has | locks to keep the baddies out   But they're |

    | D              A/C#           | E  \\  \\  Fdim7    |
    | Mostly used to lock ourselves | in.      This is  |

    | My house    and it's | fine.    It's|
