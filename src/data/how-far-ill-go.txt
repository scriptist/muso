[Intro]
C F
 
[Verse 1]
C                                    Dm7
I've been staring at the edge of the water
                 Am                      F
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
C                             Dm7
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
                       Am                         F
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
      Am
Every turn I take, every trail I track
      G
Every path I make, every road leads back
       C
To the place I know, where I can not go
         Fm
Where I long to be
 
[Chorus 1]
        C                                      G
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
           Am                F
And no one knows, how far it goes
       C                                    G
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             Am         Fm
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
 
[Interlude]
C G Am F
 
[Verse 2]
C                         Dm7                         Am
I know, everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
                F
Everything is by design
C                         Dm7                     Am
I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island
                      F
So maybe I can roll with mine
      Am
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
        G
I'll be satisfied if I play along
        C
But the voice inside sings a different song
        Fm
What is wrong with me?
 
[Chorus 2]
        C                                      G
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
           Am                 F
But no one knows, how deep it goes
       C                                             G
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
           Am             F
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
 
[Chorus 3]
         C#                                     G#
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
           A#m               F#
And no one knows, how far it goes
       C#                                   G#
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             A#m                F#m
One day I'll know, how far I'll go
