[Intro]
G Am Em C
 
[Verse]
G                Am
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, 
Em
drifting through the wind 
C
wanting to start again? 
G                Am
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin 
Em
like a house of cards,
C
one blow from caving in? 
G                Am
Do you ever feel already buried deep? 
Em                        C
6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing 
G                        Am
Do you know that there's still a chance for you 
Em
'Cause there's a spark in you 
C
You just gotta
 
[Pre-Chorus]
  G          Am         Em     C
Ignite, the light, and let it shine 
     G       Am             Em        C
Just own the night like the 4th of July 
 
[Chorus]
                      G    Am
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Em           C
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
             G          Am
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Em    C
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
               G    Am
Baby, you're a firework 
                   Em     C
Come on, let your colors burst 
             G          Am
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Em              C
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
 
[Verse 2]
G                     Am
You don't have to feel like a waste of space 
Em             C
You're original, cannot be replaced 
G               Am
If you only knew what the future holds 
Em                      C
After a hurricane comes a rainbow 
 
G                     Am
Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed 
Em                       C
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road 
G                     Am
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow 
Em
And when it's time, you'll know 
C
You just gotta
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G          Am          Em     C
Ignite, the light, and let it shine 
     G       Am             Em        C
Just own the night like the 4th of July 
 
[Chorus]
                      G    Am
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Em           C
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
             G          Am
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Em    C
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
               G    Am
Baby, you're a firework 
                   Em     C
Come on, let your colors burst 
             G          Am
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Em              C
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
 
[Bridge]
Em
Boom, boom, boom       
                      C
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
                           G
It's always been inside of you, you, you 
                            D
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough 
 
[Chorus]
                      G    Am
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Em           C
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
             G          Am
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Em    C
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
               G    Am
Baby, you're a firework 
                   Em     C
Come on, let your colors burst 
             G          Am
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Em              C
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
 
[Outro]
G               Am
Boom, boom, boom 
                       Em              C
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
G               Am
Boom, boom, boom 
                        Em             C
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
