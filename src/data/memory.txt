[Verse 1]
C                              Am
Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
                      F                       Em
Has the moon lost her memory? She is smiling alone
       Dm                               Am
In the lamplight the withered leaves collect at my feet
        G              C
And the wind begins to moan
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                        Am
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
                   F                         Em
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
    Dm                          Am
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
        G            C
Let the memory live again
 
 
[Bridge]
Em       F       Em         F
Every streetlamp seems to beat
  Em  C     D   G
A fatalis - tic warning
Em        Am7          D          Gmaj7
Someone mutters, and a streetlamp gutters
    Em       G/A A7 D
And soon it will be morning
 
 
[Verse 3]
C                             Am
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
                  F                            Em
I must think of a new life, and I mustn't give in
         Dm                            Am
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
      G       F/G    C
And a new day will begin

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
                   Ab                       Gm
All alone with the memory of my days in the sun
       Fm                               Cm
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
        Bb      Ab/Bb Eb
Look, a new day has begun
