E                         G#/D#
This is the song for Phil Daoust
           C#m                C       B
Occasional Guardian-newspaper Journal-oust
E                 G#/D#
I never-ever-ever mentioned your name
       C#m                         B
Or the review you wrote when I was new to this game
C#m                  G#/C
But now the time has come
             E/B                       F#/A#
I think I've dealt with my feelings at last
     A
I really wanna forgive you Phil, yeah
  E/G#
I wanna leave the past in the past-oh-oh
         E            G#/D#
And as this is London town
  C#m                              C   B
I thought I ought to take the opportunity
                 E
'Cause there's a pretty good chance
         G#/D#
Somebody out there will know you
    C#m                       B
And maybe they will pass on a message for me

C#m                 G#/C
Just wanna say Phil Daoust
           E/B                F#/A#
Occasional Guardian-newspaper Journal-oust
          A
That it's been three years since you wrote it
    E/G#
And time is very healing
      A
But I still wanna cut big chunks of flesh

Out of your stupid face
    B (this chord continues until ding-dang)
And make your children watch

While I force you to eat them.


I wanna make your children

watch you eat your own face meat

E         B
Ding-dang ding-dang-dong
C#m        G#m
This is my Phil Daoust song
A         E
Everybody sing along
A
La-la-la-la-la-la
  B
I hope one of your family members dies
E     B
Phil, ding-dang-dong
C#m                   G#m
I've written you this special song
   A                E
To help you get the attention
    A          B            E
You obviously, desperately, lack.
