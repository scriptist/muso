Gm   Gm/Eb

[Verse]
   Gm
My life is so successfull,
                                     Gm/Eb
I've got everything a man could ever need.
      Gm
Got a 1000 dollar haircut,
                              Gm/Eb
And I even have a talkshow on TV.
      Cm                      Dm   Eb
And I know I should be happy, but  instead
          Gm                             F
There's a question I can't get out of my head.-

[Chorus]
C                     Gm7
What's the meaning of Stonehenge?
     Eb
It's killing me that no one knows
    F                       C
Why it was built 5000 years ago.
C                      Gm7
Why did they build the Stonehenge?
    Eb
How could they rasie the stones so high
   F                           Cm
Completely without the technology
   Dm   Eb
We have today?

[Verse]
       Gm
When I make my jalape√±os, Calamri and prosciutto,
        Gm/Eb
I'm the king!
          Gm
My wife applaud(s) me in the kitchen,
                                         Gm/Eb
When I tell her all I bought is from the local store
             Cm                           Dm   Eb
And when the kids have gone to bed, we're all alone
               Gm                            F
She gives me a smile, Then she plays with my balls

[Chorus]
C                     Gm7
But all I think of is Stonehenge
  Eb
I think about it when I dream
    F                              C
The biggest henge that I have ever seen
C                     Gm7
What's the purpose of Stonehenge?
Eb
A giant granite birthday cake
     F                       G      Am
Or a prison far too easy to escape?

[Verse]
F
  (Stonehenge! Stonehenge! Lots of stones in a row!)
          G
They were 25 tons each stone, my friend
     Am
But amazingly they got them all down in the sand
         F
And they moved it (Stonehenge!)
And they dragged it (Stonehenge!)
         F                       G    D
And they rolled it 46 miles from Waleeees!

                      Am7
(What's the deal with Stonehenge?)
Oh, what's the deal, what's the deal, what's the deal?
    F
You should have left a tiny hint
         G                              D
when you made this fucking labyrinth of stone! (Who the...)
                      Am7
Who the fuck builds a Stonehenge? (fuck builds a Stonehenge?)
    F
Two Stone Age-guys wondering what to do
    G                                        A
Who just said: "Dude, let's build a henge or two!"

                Em                            A
I would give anything to know (about the Stonehenge!)
                         Em                                      A
Yeah, I would give all I have to give! (Would you give them your car?)
                                                          Em
Mmm, are you kidding me, of course I would have given the car!
                 A
(What car do you drive?)
                              Em                            A
Drive a Civic, drive a Civic, drive a Civic! (A car you can trust!)
                                         Em                        A
Never mind the car, let's talk about the henge (What henge is that again?)
It's the Stonehenge, it's the Stonehenge!
Em                               A
God, it is the greatest henge of all!
                      Em
What's the meaning of Stonehenge?
