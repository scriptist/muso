Am C Em D  Am C Em D
 
           Am             C                  Em               D
When I was younger I was certain that I'd be fine without a queen
       Am               C               Em           D
Just a king inside his castle, with an ocean in between
    Am          C                  G               D/F#
Now all I do is sit and count the miles from you to me. 
       A     C  B7
Oh, Calamity
 
       Am            C               Em            D
We get older by the hour, watch the changes from afar
        Am            C                   Em             D
Keep forgetting to remember, where we've been is who we are
    Am          C              G           D/F#
Now all I do is wonder why we ever set the scene. 
      A     C  D
Oh, Calamity
 
             C             G     D
It's such a shame that we play strangers,
Em        C           G       D
No act to change what we've become.
Em                C           G          B7          Em
Damn, it's such a shame that we built a wreck out of me,
       A             C     B7
Oh, Calamity  Oh, Calamity
 
        Am             C               Em           D
I'll remember nights alone, and waking up to dial tones
         Am              C                Em            D
Always found my greatest moments, in the sound of your hello's
       Am            C                G                 D/F#
Now I struggle to recall the reasons you would come to leave.
      A      C  D
Oh, Calamity
 
            C             G     D
It's such a shame that we play strangers,
Em        C           G       D
No act to change what we've become.
Em                C           G          B7          Em
Damn, it's such a shame that we built a wreck out of me,
       A             C     B7
Oh, Calamity  Oh, Calamity
 
Am  C  Em  D  Am  C  Em  D
 
      Am                C               Em            D
If I catch you on the corner, will you even know it's me?
        Am               C          Em           D
Will I look familiar to you? Do you offer me a seat?
       Am           C                G               D/F#
Can we find a new beginning? Do you turn the other cheek? 
     A      C  D
Oh, Calamity...
 
             C          G        D
It's such a shame that we play strangers,
Em         C           G       D
No act to change what we've become.
Em                 C         G        D
Damn, it's such a shame that we play strangers,
Em         C           G       D
No act to change what we've become.
Em                C          G          B7           Em
Damn, it's such a shame that we built a wreck out of me,
       A             C     B7
Oh, Calamity  Oh, Calamity
 
Am  C  Em  D       Am     C               Em
             Oh, Calamity,   come back to me...
