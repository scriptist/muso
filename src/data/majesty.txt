Am
So am I
        C
Good or bad
                        G
The way that things did turn out
      F            Am
I did only make you sad

Am
And we cried and we cried
       C
On the phone
             G
Oh but in my mind
         F             Am
You were never that all alone

            G
Oh you were majesty
                F
Your roads were heavy
                                     Am
And your longing was a cut from bone

[ Same chord progression throughout the song ]

So am I
Am I good or bad
Could only awake your anger
I could only make you mad
Now was that how you showed me
That you were still so young and bold
Anyway those fights did drive me
And I was dying of thirst and I wasn't growing old

Oh, you were majesty
Your ropes were heavy
And your roads were very cold
Oh, oh, oh, majesty

But in my mind
I could still climb inside your bed
And I could be victorious
Still the only man to pass through the glorious arch of your head, o-oh

Oh, you were majesty
Your ropes were heavy
And your cheeks were very red

Oh, you were majesty
Now it's like I said
That spirit, it's now dead

Oh, oh, oh, majesty
