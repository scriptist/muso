                Em
Well here I am again
                 D
The pretty but na√Øve one
    A
The perky-breasted, giggly one night stand
               Em
Is it my destiny to be
          D
A brief diversion
       A                             G
Just a detour on the journey of some man?
                       D
I'm not really one for askin'
                            A
I'll play whatever role I'm cast in
                        D
Will smile with perfect teeth
                 A
And grimace underneath
                     Em7
I learned back in my teens
                       G
There's no point in protestin'
                          Em7
If you look good in tight jeans
                             A
That's what they'll want you dressed in
                              G
Once you're known for low-cut tops
                    D/F#
It's pretty hard to stop
                       Em7
It isn't easy to break free
Em7/A                    D (F# G C# D A A G F#)
        Of playing Nancy
                 D
I don't really remember
                   A
I guess I chose to be here
                D
I wasn't quite aware that
                     A
I was put here to be stared at
                          Em7
But this world I chose to live in
                 G
Is mostly run by men
                         Em7
So you take what you are given
                       A7
Just to feel the love again
                          G
So throughout the endless week
                        D/F#
And all through the weekend
                 Em7
You will find me here
Em7/A                 D (F# G C# D A A G F#)
        Playing Nancy
                             D
And look, I know this person fits me
                         A
I'm pretty good at being pretty
                            D
And I'm grateful, I mean to say
                              A
There are worse roles you can play
                     Em7
And I'd rather be up dancing
                   G
Than sad against a wall
                  Em7
It's better to be leered at
                    A7
Than not desired at all
                     G
Who am I to dream of better
                      D/F#           Em7
To dream that one day      I will be
A7                                  Gmaj7
        Something more than just collateral
                  D/F#
In someone else's battle
          Em7
I will be
Em7/A                             D (F# G C# D A A G F#)
        Something more than Nancy
