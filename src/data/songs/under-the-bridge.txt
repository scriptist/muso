[Verse]
E/B       B             C#m          G#m A
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
E/B       B           C#m     A
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
       E/B    B            C#m     G#m  A
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
E/B       B       C#m       A      Emaj7
Lonely as I am, together we cry
 
E/B            B              C#m         G#m  A
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
E/B                B            C#m             A
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
    E/B          B             C#m       G#m  A
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
E/B     B          C#m       A       Emaj7
I never worry, now that is a lie.
 
[Chorus]
      F#m                  E/B  B*     F#m
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
F#m                    E/B   B*      F#m
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
F#m                  E/B  B*     F#m
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
F#m                    E/B   B*      F#m       E/B  B   C#m   G#m    A    E/B    B    C#m    A
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
 
[Verse]
     E/B        B                 C#m    G#m A
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
     E/B        B        C#m     A
It's hard to believe and I'm all alone
   E/B          B             C#m      G#m   A
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
E/B       B       C#m       A      Emaj7
Lonely as I am, together we cry
 
[Chorus]
     F#m                  E/B  B*     F#m
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
F#m                    E/B   B*      F#m
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
      F#m                  E/B  B*     F#m
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
F#m                    E/B   B*      F#m       A  Am    G     F
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
