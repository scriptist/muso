[INTRO]

F C Dm C Bb C F (Hold last F for a whole bar)


[VERSE 1]

Gm                      C
When are you gonna come down
F                     Bb
When are you going to land
  Gm                        C
I should have stayed on the farm, should have
F                  F
Listened to my old man
    Gm                        C
You know you can't hold me forever
  F                   Bb
I didn't sign up with you
    Eb                     C
I'm not a present for your friends to open
     F                     F
This boy's too young to be singing
    Db  Eb   Ab  Db   Bbm  C7
The blues... Ah...... Ah....


[CHORUS]

   F                    A7
So Goodbye yellow brick road
          Bb              F
Where the dogs of society howl
    D7                     Gm
You can't plant me in your penthouse
    C                F
I'm going back to my plow
Dm                      A
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Bb                      Db
Hunting the horny black toad
Db Eb   F         C/E      Dm       Dm/C
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
   Bb      C            Db  Eb
Beyond the yellow brick road ...
Ab  Db  Bbm  C  F
Ah..... Ah......


[VERSE 2]

Gm                       C
What do you think you'll do then?
  F                      Bb
I bet to shoot down your plane
      Gm                   C
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
   F                     F
To set you on your feet again
Gm                   C
Maybe you'll get a replacement
        F                    Bb
There's plenty like me to be found
Eb           C
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
F                         F
Sniffing for tidbits like you
       Db  Eb    Ab  Db  Bbm  C7
On the ground... Ah....  Ah....


[CHORUS]

   F                    A7
So Goodbye yellow brick road
          Bb              F
Where the dogs of society howl
    D7                     Gm
You can't plant me in your penthouse
    C                F
I'm going back to my plow
Dm                      A
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Bb                      Db
Hunting the horny black toad
Db Eb   F         C/E      Dm       Dm/C
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
   Bb      C            Db  Eb
Beyond the yellow brick road ...
Ab  Db  Bbm  C  F
Ah..... Ah......
