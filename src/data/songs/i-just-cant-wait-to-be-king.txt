D              Dsus4  D
I'm gonna be a mighty king
D            Dsus4 D
So enemies beware!
           G7
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts
     G               D
With quite so little hair
 
 
 
D                Dsus4 D
I'm gonna be the main event
D                  Dsus4 D
Like no king was before
    G7
I'm brushing up on looking down
    G             D
I'm working on my ROAR
     Em            Em7         A7
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
      G          A          D Dsus4 D Dsus4
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
 
 
[You've rather a long way to go,]
 
[young master, if you think...]
 
 
              G
No one saying do this
 
[Now when I said that, I--]
              Em7
No one saying be there
 
[What I meant was...]
              A7
No one saying stop that
 
[Look, what you don't realize...]
              Dsus4 D
No one saying see here
 
[Now see here!]
Em           Em7       A7
Free to run around all day
 
[Well, that's definitely out...]
G             A      D Dsus4 D Dsus4
Free to do it all my way!
 
 
 
D                      Dsus4   D
I think it's time that you and I
D                   Dsus4 D
Arranged a heart to heart
G7
Kings don't need advice
            G               D
From little hornbills for a start
 
 
 
D                    Dsus4       D
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Dsus4    D
Count me out!
       G               G7
Out of service, out of Africa
  G              D       Dsus4 D
I wouldn't hang about... aagh!
Em                    Em7           A7
This child is getting wildly out of wing
      G          A          D
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

          G
Everybody look left
          Em7
Everybody look right
               A7
Everywhere you look I'm
                Dsus4 D
Standing in the spotlight!
 
 
[Not yet!]
 
 
Em                 Em7              A7
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Em                   Em7             A7
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
Em                 Em7            A7
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling
 
 
 
G               A          D      Dsus4 D
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
G               A          D      Dsus4 D
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
G               A                   D      Dsus4 D
Oh I just can't waaaaaait ... to be king!
