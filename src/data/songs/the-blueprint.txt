C9b5        C9b5/A       G
Almost done working on a blueprint
C9b5         C9b5/A     G
Action plan,    you and me
C9b5      C9b5/A           G
Pin it up on the wall, the blueprint
     C9b5           C9b5/A     C9
It's time we began,    you and me


      C9
We'll buy a little house together
C9/A
     In the inner city
C9
Have a baby


          G         D/F#  C9/E       C9
And we'll close the local pubs down
G         D/F#  C9/E       C9
Close the local pubs down
    Em               Em/F#      Em/G
And then we'll buy a four-wheel drive and
Am              Am/B  Am/C     D              Dsus4  D
clog up all the cafes with our massive prams

C9b5            C9b5/A           G
See I've drawn, look here on the blueprint
C9b5           C9b5/A  G
See that's you,        jogging

C9                        C9/A               C9
With your iPod Nano, your favourite playlist    of Aussie rock bands



          G         D/F#  C9/E       C9
While you close the local pubs down
G         D/F#  C9/E       C9
Close the local pubs down

G
I've worked it out, it's all prepared
    C
The life we'll have when we are wed
     C9
I've made a diorama
     Cm
Tiny papa tiny mama
     G             D/F#             Em
Tiny thirty dollar mains on all the menus
Cm                                                      Dsus4
Tiny scale model licensing restrictions on all the live venues


C9b5                   C9b5/A       G
Me and you, let's move to where the music is
C9b5                   C9b5/A       -
                                And stop it
