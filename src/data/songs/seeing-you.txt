Dm                            F                       C
    Drove out of town, took a right onto a northbound highway
Dm  F                     C
       Was it really only yesterday
Dm                            F            C
    If I had known what now I know maybe I
                   Gm         Bb
Would have taken a moment
                     Gm       Bb
Maybe looked over my shoulder
             F
Maybe shed a tear
        A    A/G A/F A/E
Now I'm here


[Verse 2]

Dm                        F                                      C
   A storm rolled in, overwhelmed me some time late this morning
Dm  F                          C
       Think I ignored the warnings
Dm                             F                     C
   I spent a lifetime seeking signs, reading lines
                       Gm      Bb
Trying to forecast the future
                      Gm       Bb
Always staying a day ahead
                   F
Well that was the idea
        A    A/G A/F A/E
Now I'm here


[Chorus]

Bb                                Dm            C
   I thought I'd seen it all, was sure by now I knew this place
Bb                           Dm                C
   I swear that I knew every hair, each line upon your face
Bb                           Dm              C
   I thought the only way to better days was through tomorrow

Gm                     Bb
   But I know now that I know
Gm                     Bb
   Yes I know now that I know nothing

        F             Am
But I'm here, and I'm fine
        Dm     Am Bb                F
And I'm seeing you   for the first time
      C              Dm     Am Bb                 F   F/E
I'm alright, and I'm seeing you   for the first time

  I thought I knew everything there was to know
            G                    Bm              A
  And I was sure the only way to better days was through tomorrow

I'm here, and I'm fine
        Bm     A G                 D
And I'm seeing you for the first time
      A              Bm     A G
I'm alright, and I'm seeing you
