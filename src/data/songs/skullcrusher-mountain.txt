E                    Esus4                E       Esus4
Welcome to my secret lair on Skullcrusher Mountain
  E                             Esus4
I hope that you've enjoyed your stay so far
          E7
I see you met my assistant Scarface
      A                     E
His appearance is quite disturbing
        A                       B7
but I assure you he's harmless enough
       A                    E
He's a sweetheart, calls me Master
             A      B7      A      B7
And he has a way of finding pretty things
    A                B7
and bringing them to me

Chorus
E
I'm so into you
        Bm
But I'm way too smart for you
        A
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy
           Am
I'm not surprised that you agree
             E
If you could find some way to be
             Bm
A little bit less afraid of me
              A
You'd see the voices that control me
       Am
from inside my head
    D7                 E       Esus4
Say I shouldn't kill you....yet

  E                        Esus4             E         Esus4
I made this half-pony half-monkey monster to please you
E                          Esus4
But I get the feeling that you don't like it
E7
What's with all the screaming?
         A                 E
You like monkeys, you like ponies
          A                      B7
Maybe you don't like monsters so much
        A             E
Maybe I used too many monkeys
         A         B7          A        B7
Isn't it enough to know that I ruined a pony
A                 B7
making a gift for you?

Chorus
E
I'm so into you
        Bm
But I'm way too smart for you
        A
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy
           Am
I'm not surprised that you agree
             E
If you could find some way to be
             Bm
A little bit less afraid of me
              A
You'd see the voices that control me
       Am
from inside my head
    D7                 E       Esus4 E E7
Say I shouldn't kill you....yet

Bridge

            A                         G#m
Picture the two of us alone inside my golden submarine
         A                  B7
While up above the waves my doomsday squad
  E             E7
ignites the atmosphere
            A
And all the fools who lead their foolish lives
    G#m             C#7
may find it quite explosive
        F#m                              A                B7
Well it won't mean half as much to me if I don't have you here

Verse 3

    E                         Esus4                E       Esus4
You know it isn't easy living here on Skullcrusher Mountain
   E                             Esus4
So maybe you could cut me just a little slack
         E7
Would it kill you to be civil?
          A                  E
I've been patient, I've been gracious
         A                        B7
And this mountain is covered with wolves
          A                  E
Hear them howling, my hungry children
                 A        B7     A     B7
Maybe you should stay and have another drink
    A                  B7
and think about me and you

Final Chorus
E
I'm so into you
        Bm
But I'm way too smart for you
        A
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy
           Am
I'm not surprised that you agree
             E
If you could find some way to be
             Bm
A little bit less afraid of me
              A
You'd see the voices that control me
       Am
from inside my head
    D7                 E
Say I shouldn't kill you yet
D7                 E
I shouldn't kill you yet
D7                 E    Esus E
I shouldn't kill you yet
