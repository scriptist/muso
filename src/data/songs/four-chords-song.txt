My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure

People killed and people dyin
children hurt and hear them crying
can you practise what you preach
won't you turn the other cheek

Forever young,
I wanna be forever young

I won't hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

This is the way you left me, I'm not pretending
No love no hope to glory, no happy ending

'Cause you are amazing
Oh we did amazing things

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go

Can you feel the love tonight

And she will be loved,
Yeah she will be loved.

Oh take me home, country road,
To the place where I belong

And I wanna TV embrace

I'm your biggest fan I follow you until you love me
pappa papparazzi

I can't live with or without you

Whenever I fall at your feet
You let your tears...

Am I not pretty enough, is my heart too broken

----

When I find myself in times of trouble,
Mother Mary comes to me.

I'm startin' with the man in the mirror

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner.

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin
You'll go ridin' on the horses yeah yeah

No woman no cry

Mama this surely is a dream

I come from the land down under

Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong

Dinky di true blue, the funny things you do,
Australia, Australia, this is you

Taylor was a good girl, never want to be late,
complain, express, ideas in her brain,

I need some love like I never needed love before,
Wanna make love to your baby

Take on me, Take me out,
I'll be gone, In a day...

Save tonight, and find the break of dawn.
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone.

Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.

I know she's playing with me.
Well that's okay 'cause I got no self-esteem.

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes

In your head, in your head,
Zombie, zombie, zombie

It's too late too apologize.
It's too late.

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face

Come on Barbie let's go party

I'm not here for your entertainment,
You don't really want to mess with with me tonight

Take your canvas bags, take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags to the supermarket

SOLO

Time to say goodbye

Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?

I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane.
I'm a birdplane. A mother fuckin' birdplane.

Doesn't that sound familiar?
Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver,
The way that things have gone?
And doesn't that seem peculiar,
'Cause everyone wants a little more?
It's something I do remember
to never go this far.
That's all it takes to be a star.
