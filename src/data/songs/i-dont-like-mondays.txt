[Verse 1]

    B              D#m                E               F#
The silicon chip inside her head gets switched to overload,
    B                    D#m
And nobody's gonna go to school today, she’s gonna
E                 F#
Make them stay at home,
    E                  F#
And daddy doesn't understand it,
          B                           E
He always said she was good as gold.
           E
And he can see no reasons, cos there are no reasons,
     E                         F#     F#6    F#7
What reasons do you need to be shown?


[Hook]

        B                B/A#
Tell me why I don't like Mondays,
        E/G#             F#
Tell me why I don't like Mondays,
        B  [TO CODA]     B/A#
Tell me why I don't like Mondays,
        E                  F#
I wanna shoot, Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh,
              B          D#m    E     F#  E
The whole day down.


[Verse 2]

The Telex machine is kept so clean,
And it types to a waiting world,
And Mother feels so shocked, Father's world is rocked,
And their thoughts turn to their own little girl.
Sweet sixteen ain't that peachy keen,
No, it ain't so neat to admit defeat,
They can see no reasons Cos there are no reasons
What reasons do you need?


[Hook]

        B                B/A#
Tell me why I don't like Mondays,
        E/G#             F#
Tell me why I don't like Mondays,
        B  [TO CODA]     B/A#
Tell me why I don't like Mondays,
        E                  F#
I wanna shoot, Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh,
              D#sus4  D#m    D#sus4   D#m          B          Bsus4
The whole day down,   down,  down,    shoot it all down...

[Verse 3]

B                        D#m
Playing’s stopped in the playground, now.
    E                      F#
She wants to play with her toys a while.
    B                      D#m
And school's out early and soon we'll be learning
        E               F#
And the lesson today is how to die.
             E                          F#sus4
And then the bullhorn crackles, and the captain tackles,
         B                E/B   B        E
With the problems and the how's and why's
           E                         E
And he can see no reasons, cos there are no reasons
     E                     F#   F#6  F#7
What reason do you need to die, die? Oooh, and

        B  [TO CODA]     B/A#
Tell me why I don't like Mondays,

The whole day down.

B                  B/A#                       E/G#

F#               B                  D#m                        E
