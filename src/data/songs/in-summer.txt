Kristoff: Really? I’m guessing you don’t have much experience with heat.

Olaf:
          C                     Dm            Em          Dm
Nope! But sometimes I like to close my eyes, and imagine what it’ll
          C                     Dm            Em          Dm
be like when summer does come.


C       Dm     Em               Dm
Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz
    Em7     Am        Dm        G       C   Dm   Dm7   G
And I’ll be doing whatever snow does in summer.
  C           Dm       Em                  Dm
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand
E       Am      Dm         G         C
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in summer.


     F                                  C
I’ll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm.
    Am                       D                F  F/E  G/D
And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm!

      C             Dm           Em                   Ddim
And I can’t wait to see, what my buddies all think of me.
      E      Am       Dm          G     C
Just imagine how much cooler I’ll be in summer.


C                   Dm           C      Dm
Dah dah, da doo, uh bah bah bah bah bah boo
    Em
The hot and the cold are both so intense,
G
Put 'em together it just makes sense!


C                   Dm           Em       Dm

F
Winter’s a good time to stay in and cuddle,
    G                                N.C.
But put me in summer and I’ll be a — happy snowman!


F                               C             G
When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream,
     Am            D                F       F/E G/D
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin’ off steam.


       C            Dm        Em                     Ddim
Oh the sky would be blue, and you guys will be there too
       Em      Am      Dm            G     C
When I finally do what frozen things do in summer.

Anna: Don’t you dare!
