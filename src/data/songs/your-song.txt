D G A G

D                 G          A         F#m
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
Bm                           Bm7    G
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
D                 A          F#       Bm
I don't have much money but, boy if I did
D             Em           G             A
I'd buy a big house where, we both could live

D          G         A               F#m
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Bm                              Bm7       G
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
D               A                  F#         Bm
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
D             Em        G              D
My gift is my song and, this one's for you

A                Bm         Em           G
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
A         Bm                Em            G
It may be quite simple but, now that it's done
  Bm
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
       Bm7         G
that I put down in words
    D         Em             G             A
How wonderful life is, while you're in the world

D            G         A              F#m
I sat on the roof and, kicked off the moss
Bm                                     Bm7          G
Well a few of the verses well, they've got me quite cross
D                        A             F#         Bm
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
D                    Em        G              A
It's for people like you, that keep it turned on

     D          G            A              F#m
So excuse me forgetting but, these things I do
    Bm                             Bm7              G
You see I've forgotten if they're, green or they're blue
D           A         F#            Bm
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
D             Em             G         D
Yours are the sweetest eyes, I've ever seen

A                Bm         Em           G
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
A         Bm                Em            G
It may be quite simple but, now that it's done
  Bm
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
       Bm7         G
that I put down in words
    D         Em             G             A
How wonderful life is, while you're in the world

  Bm                     Bm7
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
       Bm          G
that I put down in words
    D         Em             G             D
How wonderful life is, while you're in the world
