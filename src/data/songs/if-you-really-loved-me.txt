              Gm           Dmaj#5/Gb
If you really loved me the way you say you do
Bb/F                           Gm/E
If you love me half as much as I love you
          Cm7/Eb                  Bb
You would pluck a planet from the sky
          A                      D
You would use a star to dot the "i"


           Gm    Dmaj#5/Gb
In "I love you", that is what you'd do
      Bb/F                            Gm/E
You'd take a dreary day and you would paint it blue
       Cm7/Eb                Bb
If you loved me unconditionally
A                                          D
These are the things that you would do for me

          Gm              Dmaj#5/Gb
Because I need you like a fish needs the sea
       Bb/F                      Gm/E
Like a fire needs oxygen, like a flower needs a bee
    Cm7/Eb                  Bb
And if you really cared for me
      A                          D
You'd let me video you while you wee
                   Gm                Dmaj#5/Gb
Standing up in the bath, I shouldn't even have to ask
   Bb/F                           Gm/E
Perhaps you'd even store a little more in a flask
          Cm7/Eb                      Bb
These are just the things that people do
           A             D         Gm
When their love for one another is true

Ba doo doo


        Gm          Dmaj#5/Gb
We go together like toast and pate
     Bb/F                       Gm/E
Like racism and ignorance, like Jews and Hogmanay
           Cm7/Eb                  Bb
But if you really want to show you care
      A                     D
You'd let me wear your underwear
                   Gm          Dmaj#5/Gb
When we visit your mum; it's a bit of harmless fun
            Bb/F                                   Gm/E
I just like talking about your childhood with some lace between my buns
           Cm7/Eb              Bb
There's no reason for a big to-do
        A             D         Gm
If your love for one another is true

Ba doo doo

        Gm            Dmaj#5/Gb
We go together like a bird and a nest
     Bb/F                           Gm/E
Like Internet and kiddie porn, like guns and the US
           Cm7/Eb                   Bb
And if you love me like you say you do
      A                   D
You'd purchase forty cockatoos
                  Gm        Dmaj#5/Gb
And teach them to fly in formation in the sky
    Bb/F                              Gm/E
And shit the words "Tim is God" on my ex-girlfriend's Hyundai
         Cm7/Eb               Bb
Sure, it might be easier with doves
    A                               D          Eb
But shirking challenges is not what love's all about


D                        Eb
Love is not all wine and roses
D                            Eb
Sometimes it’s handcuffs and cheese
C/E                     F
No one said love is for free
       Am/E
And if you agree with that
               Cm/Eb                           D7                            Gm
You'll sing me passages from the Koran wearing nothing but a Bob the Builder hat
                Dmaj#5/Gb
To the tune of 'Waltzing Matilda'
       Dm/F                    Gm/E                   Eb/F  F   E
I just love the combination of Islam, nationalism and builder


          Am              Emaj#5/Ab
Because I need you like a tick needs a tock
       C/G                        D7/Gb
Like bananas need pyjamas, like a nun needs cock
           Dm7/F                        C
And if you want to put your love for me first
    B                        E
You wouldn't go through childbirth
               Am            Emaj#5/Ab
You'd agree to adopt so that you could stay thin
            C/G                   D7/Gb
We'll get a Chinese kid, it could teach us Mandarin
    Dm7/F                         C
And Communists don't make as much noise
            B              E             Am   G
And they're really good at sharing their toys

          Cm              Gmaj#5/B
Because I dig you like an Aussie digs pies
     Eb/Bb                       F7/A
Like Born-Agains dig Jesus, like Jesus dug guys
           Ab                 Eb
And if you love me just a modicum
     D                    G
You’d softly rub my perineum
                            Cm     Gmaj#5/B
And stick your finger up my bum as I’m about to cum
     Eb/Bb                              F7/A
I’ve heard it’s quite acceptable and surprisingly fun
            Ab                        Eb
Not that I'm saying that I'd want you to
        Ab                                                   Eb
But hypothetically it’s something, it is something you might do
       Ab                    Eb
If you loved me unconditionally
     D              G               Ab
Like letting me video you while you wee
G                                          Cm
Assuming there’s nothing worth watching on TV
