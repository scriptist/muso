[Verse]
C   Em  F       C  Em  F
 
[Verse]
G
    Don't wish it away
      Em               F      C  F  C  F  C  F
Don't look at it like it's forever
   C            G                   Bm
Between you and me I could honestly say
      F                   C  F  C  F  C  F
That things can only get better
 
[Bridge]
     C         G
And while I'm away
B7                    Em
Dust out the demons inside
G7/D                  C                     G
     And it won't be long before you and me run
                    Am      F        G
To the place in our hearts where we hide
 
[Chorus]
Am7  G7/B      C                     G/B          F
         And I guess that's why they call it the blues
            C              G              F
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
C             G                      Am
Laughing like children, living like lovers
C/E           F                D/F#
Rolling like thunder under the covers
       F                    F/G          C    Em    F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
 
[Verse]
G
    Just stare into space
Em         F             C  F  C  F  C  F
Picture my face in your hands
C             G                  Bm
Live for each second without hesitation
    F                     C  F  C  F  C  F
And never forget I'm your man
 
[Bridge]
C          G
Wait on me girl
B7                      Em
Cry in the night if it helps
G7/D                C                 G
     But more than ever I simply love you
             Am    F     G
More than I love life itself
 
[Chorus]
Am7  G7/B    C                    G/B          F
      And I guess that's why they call it the blues
            C              G              F
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
C              G                     Am
Laughing like children, living like lovers
C/E           F                D/F#
Rolling like thunder under the covers
       F                    F/G         C        Em    F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
