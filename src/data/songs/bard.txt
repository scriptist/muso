Meet you by the art room door
                   C                  G
In a circle on the hallway floor
                 C                    G
Teacher held you back again
                      C               G
Drawing ogres in your textbook margin
Am                                 F
Keeping your eyes down and dodging oranges
       Am
On the bus trip home
                 G
Every day you're battle-scarred
                  F
You'll grow up to be a bard
                  C           G
You'll grow up to be a bard

                 C                    G
Hurt yourself at sports again
                    C                 G
You're not made for mud and wind
                     C                G
Limping home through quiet streets
                  C                   G
Sprinkler spits a snare drum beat
Am                                  F
Kids down on the vacant block throw rocks at you
                   Am
For talking to yourself again
                   G
Days like this are way too hard
                  F
You'll grow up to be a bard
                  C           G
You'll grow up to be a bard

You'll tell your own daughter stories
                            Am
She'll get some dice of her own one day
         F                           C
They can trademark the name all they like
                            Am
It's all ripped off Tolkien anyway
       F                       C
'Cause dragons and dungeons go back
               Am
They go back a long, long way
                  G
And they won't go away
              F
They won't go away

Meet you by the art room door
In a circle on the hallway floor
Made up a new map last night
It's got a dragon and a wizard fight
Once the ranger and the thief get here
We can lock the door
Shut the noise out from the yard
Then we can let down our guard

You'll grow up to be a bard
You'll grow up to...
You'll grow up to be a bard
You'll grow up to...
