[Intro]
F/A   A#2 Csus x3

[Verse]
   F/A          A#2         Csus
I've learned to slam on the brake
F/A          A#2       Csus
Before I even turn the key
F/A        A#2      Csus
Before I make the mistake
F/A      A#2          Dm       Csus
Before I lead with the worst of me
F/A          A#2        Csus
Give them no reason to stare
F/A          A#2         Csus
No slipping up if you slip away
F/A          A#2         Csus
So I've got nothing to share
F/A    A#2   Dm      Csus
No, I got nothing to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Gm            Dm           Csus
Step out, step out of the sun
F/A                  A#
If you keep getting burned
Gm            Dm           Csus
Step out, step out of the sun
F/A                A#     Csus
Because you've learned, because you've learned

[Chorus]
 Dm              A#
On the outside always looking in
        F            Csus
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
           Dm                         A#
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
      F                Csus
I'm waving through a window
   Dm                  A#
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
     F                    Csus
So I wait around for an answer to appear
           Dm                           A#
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
    F                Csus
I'm waving through a window
A7  Dm               F               Csus
Oh,      can anybody see, is anybody waving
F/A      A#2   Csus
Back at me?

F/A   A#2 Csus

[Verse]
F/A          A#2         Csus
We start with stars in our eyes
F/A          A#2         Csus
We start believing that we belong
F/A          A#2         Csus
But every sun doesn't rise
F/A    A#2   Dm      Csus
And no one tells you where you went wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Gm            Dm           Csus
Step out, step out of the sun
F/A                  A#
If you keep getting burned
Gm            Dm           Csus
Step out, step out of the sun
F/A                A#     Csus
Because you've learned, because you've learned

[Chorus]
 Dm              A#
On the outside always looking in
        F            Csus
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
           Dm                         A#
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
      F                Csus
I'm waving through a window
   Dm                  A#
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
     F                    Csus
So I wait around for an answer to appear
           Dm                           A#
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
    F                Csus
I'm waving through a window
A7  Dm               F               Csus
Oh,      can anybody see, is anybody waving

[Bridge]
             F/A          A#2                Csus    Dm
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
       F/A          A#2       Csus        Dm
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
             F/A          A#2                Csus    Dm
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
       F/A          A#2       Csus        Dm
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
             F/A          A#2                Csus    Dm
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
       F/A          A#2       Csus        Dm
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
             F/A          A#2                Csus    Dm
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
       F/A          A#2       Csus        Dm
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
       F/A         A#2
Did I even make a sound
       Csus        Dm
Did I even make a sound
             F/A           A#2
It's like I never made a sound
        Csus
Will I ever make a sound?

[Chorus]
D#m              B
On the outside always looking in
        Gb           C#sus
Will I ever be more than I've always been
           D#m                      B
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
   Gb           C#sus
Waving through a window
 D#m                 B
I try to speak but nobody can hear
     Gb                  C#sus
So I wait around for an answer to appear
            D#m                       B
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Gb               C#sus
Waving through a window
A#7 D#m             Gb              C#sus
Oh,     can anybody see, is anybody waving
Gb/A#  B2    C#sus
back at me?
Gb/A#  B2    C#sus
Is anybody waving
D#m     C#/F    B    Gb
Waving, waving, oh
