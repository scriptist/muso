[Verse]
C         G         C              G
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
C        G         F           G
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
F            C       F              C
Silently the senses abandon their defences

F Bb F C Dm Em


[Chorus]
C       G       C                 G
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour
C         G         F             G
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
F              C             F               C
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
          F              Bb    F         C
Turn your face away from cold, unfeeling light
F                 G7           C
And listen to the music of the night


[Verse]
Bb                                   Eb
Close you eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
          Ab                             D     D7
Purge all thoughts of the world you knew before
           G              G7              C
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
           Em             B           E
And you'll live as you've never lived before


[Chorus]
C       G       C           G
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
C        G        F        G
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
F            C              F         C
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
        F                  Bb       F      C
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
    F               G7           C
The darkness of the music of the night


[Verse]
         Bb                             Eb
Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world
          Ab                             D
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
         G             G7                C
Let your soul take you where you long to be
     Em       B             E
Only then can you belong to me


[Chorus]
C         G        C     G
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
C         G         F           G
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation
F             C               F           C
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
       F            Bb    F      C
To the power of the music that I write
F                G7           C
The power of the music of the night

G C G C G F G7 F C F C

F             Bb      F         C
You alone can make my song take flight
F                G7           F     Dm Dbm B C
Help me make the music of the night
