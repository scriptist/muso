[Verse]
             Cm  Gm7/C
I've paid my dues
           Cm  Gm7/C
Time after time
             Cm     Gm7/C
I've done my sentence
                 Cm  Gm7/C
But committed no crime
           Eb   Ab/Eb
And bad mistakes
            Eb  Ab/Eb
I've made a few
            Eb            Bb/D         Cm
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
    F7        Bb
But I've come through
                 Ab/Bb   Bbm7b5  Bb7     C7
And I mean to go on, and on, and on, and on
 
[Chorus]
F          Am            Dm     Bb C7
We are the champions, my friends
    F             Am                Bb  F#dim7
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
Gm7        C7/G       Bbm6   Bbm6/Db   Edim7  Gdim7
We are the champions, we are the       cham - pions
F           Ebadd9/G      Ab6        Bb       Cm7add4
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions
       Fm   Gm7   Fm   Gm7/F   Fm   Gm7/C
Of the world
 
[Verse]
                Cm  Gm7/C
I've taken my bows
               Cm  Gm7/C
And my curtain calls
               Cm
You brought me fame and fortune
                    Gm7/C
And everything that goes with it
            Cm  Gm7/C
I thank you all
                        Eb  Ab/Eb
But it s been no bed of roses
            Eb  Ab/Eb
No pleasure cruise
                Eb
I consider it a challenge
           Bb/D        Cm
Before the whole human race
    F7            Bb
And I ain't gonna lose
                 Ab/Bb   Bbm7b5  Bb7     C7
And I mean to go on, and on, and on, and on
 
[Chorus]
F          Am            Dm     Bb C7
We are the champions, my friends
    F             Am                Bb  F#dim7
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
Gm7        C7/G       Bbm6   Bbm6/Db   Edim7  Gdim7
We are the champions, we are the       cham - pions
F           Ebadd9/G      Ab6        Bb       Cm7add4
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions
       F
Of the world
 
[Outro]
F          Am            Dm     Bb C7
We are the champions, my friends
    F             Am                Bb  F#dim7
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
Gm7        C7/G       Bbm6   Bbm6/Db   Edim7  Gdim7
We are the champions, we are the       cham - pions
F           Ebadd9/G      Ab6        Bb       Cm7add4
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions
