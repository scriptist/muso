G
I don't want  lot for Christmas.
G/B
There is just on thing I need.
C                               Cm/Eb
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree.
G/D             B/A         Em                  Cm/Eb
I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know.
G/D               E7    Am             Am/D
Make my wish come true, all I want for Christmas
   G      Em      C      D
Is you

G
I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need
    C                               Cm/Eb
And I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
G
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
C                               Cm/Eb
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
G                      B7
I just want you for my own
Em                       Cm/Eb
more than you could ever know
G/D               E
Make my wish come true
Am             Am/D         G      Em
All I want for Christmas is you
Am  D
You baby

G
I won't ask for much this Christmas, I won't even wish for snow
    C                            Cm/Eb
And I just wanna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
G
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
C                          Cm/Eb
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
       G                       B7
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Em                  Cm/Eb
Holding on to me so tight
G/D             E
What more can I do
         Am             Am/D         G      Em
Oh, Baby all I want for Christmas is you'

B/A                           Em
All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
B7                          Em
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
Cm/Eb                    G/D          E7
And everyone is singing. I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Am                                                            D
Santa won't you please bring me what I really need. Won't you please bring my baby to me?


[Chorus]

G
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas this is all I'm asking for
C                          Cm/Eb
I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door
G                      B7   Em                       Cm
I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know
G/D                           E7
Make my wish come true
Am             Am/D      D  G    Em
All I want for Christmas is you
Am    D
Ooh baby
G              Em           Am  D
All I want for Christmas is you baby
G
You!
