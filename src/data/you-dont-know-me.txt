Intro: G   Bm    G    Bm   Em   Bm    Em     D

I wanna ask you -
G      Bm                        G               Bm
Do you ever sit and wonder, It's so strange That we could be together for
Em           Bm                     Em        D
So long, and never know, never care What goes on in the other one's
G                 Bm                      G         Bm
head? Things I've felt but I've never said You said things that I never said
Em          Bm                                Em    D
So I'll say something that I should have said long ago:


Am     Bm     Am    Bm     G    Bm     G     Bm
(You don't know me)
You don't know me at all
(You don't know me)
You don't know me at all (at all)

                    G                    Bm
You could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin
G       Bm                    Em
  Or a cardboard stand-up and paint me (paint me)
    Bm                      D
Any face that you wanted me To be seen. We're

Am                                     Em
Damned by the existential moment where We saw the couple in the coma and
Bm                        D
It was we were the clichï¿½,  But we carried on anyway.

Em                                   Em
So, sure, I could just close my eyes. Yeah, sure, trace and memorize,
D              D
But can you go back once you know

Am     Bm     Am    Bm     G    Bm     G     Bm
(You don't know me)
You don't know me at all
(You don't know me)
You don't know me at all (at all)

Am         Bm              C          D
(You don't know me)
You don't know me at all
(You don't know me)
You don't know me

BRIDGE:
C                          Bm      Em
If I'm the person that you think I am
C                          Bm      Em
clueless chump you seem to think I am, so
       C                               Bm
Easily led astray, an errant dog who occasionally escapes and
Em
needs a shorter leash then
C                       Bm      D
 Why the f*ck would you want me back?  Maybe it's because....

the first G of this starts with the word "because" ^^^

G Bm G Bm Em Bm Em D (x2)

(You don't know me at all)

Ahhh ah
Ahhh ah

(You don't know me,

Ahhh ah

G        Bm
So, what  I'm trying to say is
G             Bm
 What (What?)   I'm trying to tell you
     Em                 Bm
It's not gonna come out like I wanna say it
        Em
cause I know you'll only change it.
D

Am Bm Am Bm G Bm G Bm
(You don't know me)

You don't know me at all (at all)
