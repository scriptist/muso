F                               C
I have an apology to make,
                                          Dm
I'm afraid I made a big mistake,
                                           Cadd4 C
I turned my face away from You, Lord.
F                                      C
I was too blind to see the light,
                                           Dm
I was too weak to feel your might,
                                                        Cadd4  C
I closed my eyes, I couldn't see the truth, Lord.
E                                                       Am
But then like Saul on the Damascus road,
E                                                    Am
You sent a messenger to me, and so,
           F
I have had the truth revealed to me,
                 Em
Please forgive me all those things I said,
     F
I'll no longer betray you, Lord,
        G
I will pray to you instead.
                     Bb              F               C
And I will say thank you, thank you, thank you God.
Bb              F                C
Thank you, thank you, thank you God.
C                                                            G
Thank you God, for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum.
I had no idea but it's suddenly so clear,
          C                                         C7
Now I feel such a cynic how could I have been so dumb?
F
Thank you for displaying how praying works,
        C
A particular prayer in a particular church,
D                                                                                 G
Thank you Sam, for the chance to acknowledge this omnipotent ophthalmologist.
C                                                            G
Thank you God, for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum.
I didn't realise that it was so simple,
                 C                                              C7
But you've shown a great example of just how it can be done,
       F
You only need to pray in a particular spot,
              C
To a particular version of a particular god,
                 D
And if you pull that off without a hitch,
           G
He will fix one eye of one middle-class white bitch.
  Am                           Fdim7
I know in the past my outlook has been limited,
  Am                                              Fdim7
I couldn't see examples of where life had been divinitive,
      F                                   C
But I can admit it when the evidence is clear,
     D                                 G
As clear as Sam's mum's new cornea.
That's extremely clear!
Extremely clear!
C                                                            G
Thank you God, for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum.
I have to admit that in the past I have been skeptical,
      C                                                C7
But Sam described this miracle and I am overcome.
        F
How fitting that the sighting of a sight-based intervention, 
            C
Should open my eyes to this exciting new dimension.
           D
It's like someone put an eye chart on the wall in front of me,
             G
And the top five letters say I-C-G-O-D.
C                                                                                    G
Thank you Sam, for showing how my point of view has been so flawed.
I assumed there was no God at all but now I see that's cynical,
     C                                              C7
It's simply that His interests aren't particularly broad.
        F
He's largely undiverted by the starving masses,
           C
Or the inequality between the various classes.
      D
He gives out strictly limited passes,
      G
Redeemable for surgery or two-for-one glasses.
  Am                          Fdim7
I feel so shocking for historically mocking.
              Am                                 Fdim7
No, your interests are clearly confined to the ocular.
  F                                              C
I bet given the chance you'd eschew the divine,
       D                                          G
And start a little business selling contacts online.
C                                                              G
Fuck me Sam, what are the odds that of history's endless parade of gods,
That the god that you just happen to be taught to believe in
          C                           C7
Is the actual one and he digs on healing,
       F                                                                 C
But not the AIDS-ridden African nations, or the victims of the plague, or the flood-addled Asians,
      D                                                                 G
But healthy, privately-insured Australians, with common and curable corneal degeneration?
        Am	                               Fdim7
This story of Sam's has but a single explanation:
   Am                                   Fdim7
A surgical god who digs on magic operations.
        Am                                  Fdim7
No it couldn't be mistaken attribution of causation,
Am                              Fdim7
Born of a coincidental temporal correlation,
    Am                                 Fdim7
Exacerbated by a general lack of education,
Am                                     Fdim7
Vis-a-vis physics in Sam's parish congregation.
          F                                               C
And it couldn't be that all these pious people are liars.
   F                                     C
It couldn't be an artifact of confirmation bias.
    F
A product of group think,
   Cdim7
A mass delusion,
     G                                            Fdim7
An Emperor's-New-Clothes-style fear of exclusion.
           Am                               Fdim7
No it's more likely to be an all-powerful magician,
               Am                            Fdim7
Than the misdiagnosis of the initial condition,
     Am                                     Fdim7
Or one of many cases of spontaneous remission,
        Am                                        Fdim7
Or a record-keeping glitch by the local physician.
             F                              C
No, the only explanation for Sam's mum seeing:
         F                                      C
They prayed to an all-knowing super-being.
           F                                         Cdim7
To the omnipresent master of the universe,
            G                                  Fdim7
And he liked the sound of their muttered verse.
             Am                                 G
So for a bit of a change from his usual stunt,
                  F                   Em
Of being a sexist, racist, murderous cunt,
      F                                                  Em
He popped down to Dandenong and just like that,
F                             Cdim7
Used his powers to heal the cataracts,
G             G#
Of Sam's mum.
     A
Of Sam's mum.
-KEY CHANGE-
D                                                            A
Thank you God, for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum.
I didn't realise that it was such a simple thing.
  D
I feel such a ding-a-ling, what an ignorant scum.
G
Now I understand how prayer can work,
         D
A particular prayer in a particular church,
             G
In a particular style, with the particular stuff,
                  D
And for particular problems that aren't particularly tough,
                  G
And for particular people, preferably white,
                  D
And for particular senses, preferably sight,
        G
A particular prayer in a particular spot,
             Fdim7
To a particular version of a particular god.
                 A
And if you get that right, he just might,
G
Take a break from giving babies malaria,
       D
And pop down to your local area,
      E                       A          D
To fix the cataracts of your mum.
                  A   D
Hallelujah!
