Enormous Penis
          C             G7
Whenever life gets you down
           Dm          Fm
Keeps you wearing a frown
           C   D7        G7         C
And the gravy train has left you behind
               C          G7
And when you're all out of hope
             Dm          Fm
Down at the end of your rope
       F               D7          G
And nobody's there to throw you a line

         F
If you ever get so low
                Fm
That you don't know which way to go
      C             G7          C
Come on and take a walk in my shoes
         F
Never worry 'bout a thing
         D7
Got the world on a string
           G                 D7        G7
Cause I've got the cure for all of my blues


[CHORUS]
           C                  A
I take a look at my enormous penis
          D7              G        C    G7
And my troubles start a-meltin' away
           C                  A
I take a look at my enormous penis
          D7                       G7
And the happy times are comin' to stay
          F
I got a sing and I dance
         Fm
When I glance in my pants
           C                       A7
And the feelin's like a sun shiny day
           D7          G7     C    A
I take a look at my enormous pe-e-enis
        D7         G       C    G7
And everything is goin' my way


[Repeat chorus chords]

Yeah I got great big amounts
         Fm
In the place where it counts
