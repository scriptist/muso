Bb           F          Eb       F
Where in the world have you been hiding?
Bb          F    Bb
Really, you were perfect.
Bb     F      Eb        F
I only wish I knew your secret;
Bb          F   Bb
who is this new tutor?

Gm                      Eb
Father once spoke of an angel,
Cm                     D7
I used to dream he'd appear.
Gm                  Eb
Now as I sing I can sence him
      Cm        F
and I know he's here.
Bb           F       Eb       F
Here in this room he calls me softly,
Bb          F    Bb
somehwere inside hiding.
Bb        F         Eb     F
Somehow I know he's always with me;
Bb        F    Bb
he, the unseen genius.

Christine, you must have been dreaming,
Cm                           D7
stories like this can't come true.
Gm                           Eb
Christine, you're talking in riddles,
         Cm7      F
and it's not like you.
