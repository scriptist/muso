[Intro]
A Dm
 
[Verse]
                                 C                        G       G(add4)  G(add2)
There will be mornings you'll be utterly defeated by your laces
Dm                               C
Days where every look looks condescending
                      G
Empty smiles on empty faces
                                         A#
The same old places this stunning stasis
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                            F
Just let your spirit slip away
               A#                    F
Let all your troubles crumble and decay
                          A#                       F
There’s more than one way out if at the end of the day
                          C      E
You’re at the end of your rope
 
[Chorus]
              Am
Never give up hope
                   C
Never let yourself be defeated
                D                D7
If you tried it once you can try again
               F
A new day will follow
                  F
(There’s always tomorrow)
 
              Am
Never give up hope
                    C
Never listen to the unbelievers
                   D                        D7
You will take your falls, you will hit your walls
                 F
Don't give in to sorrow
                 F
There’s always tomorrow
 
[Verse]
Dm
An everlasting farcical disaster
C
You play your part, you march the march
    G
You don’t complain, you find a way
               Dm                            C
Another day surrounded by a cast of half-wit bastards
                          G
Grinning masks amidst the grey
             G
Yet you stay sane and through the pain
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           A#
The frozen pain of glass
                        F                              A#
You strain to cast your gaze upon the path you have to tread
                            F
And in your head that Lenin dread
                                A#
the fucking roads have all been trod
                                  F
And there’s no way and there’s no God
                            C
And god oh god this goddamn weather
                               E
Will last forever but you must never, never, never
 
[Chorus]
              Am
Never give up hope
                   C
Never let the odds overwhelm you
                       D                         D7
You know the game gets hard, don't throw in your cards
                 F
Don't give in to sorrow
                 F
There’s always tomorrow
 
[Bridge]
          Fm
I’ve done everything I can
             C#
I’ve done my best and I
                  Fm                              C#
And I’ve tried so hard to find my way out of this mess but I
           Ab      C#
But I’m so tired
                    Ab      C#
I swear to you I’ve tried
                             A#m
And sometimes I just want to give up
                               C#
Just give up and stay here and live
                               A#m                      C#
But I know there’s no point in denying that I will keep trying
      A#m
I’m a lot of things
    C#
But I’m not a quitter
       Cm                   C              E
I will never give up, never give up, never give up, never give up
 
[Chorus]
              Am
Never give up hope
                   C
Never let yourself be defeated
             D                  D7
You tried it once, you tried it again
                 F
There’s always tomorrow
 
[Outro]
N.C.            Am
Hold on to your faith
                    C
You’ll find another way
               Dm
After acid and gas and guns
    Dm7
And razors and rope
    F
You may wanna live
    F
But baby don’t give up
N.C.  Am
Hope
