[Intro]

   F                     Am        Dm               Gm   C
Tonight I’m gonna have myself real good time, I feel alive
        F       F7            Bb            Gm                D7
And the world turning inside out yeah, a floating around in ecstasy
    Gm   F    C  Gm7   Gm   F    C
So don’t stop me now, don’t stop me
           Gm                    C7
Cause I’m having a good time, having a good time


[Verse 1]

      F                                 Am           Dm
I’m a shooting star leaping through the sky, like a tiger
            Gm         C
Defying the law of gravity
      F                  Am               Dm
I’m a racing car passing by, like lady Godiva
          Gm     C                     F
I’m gonna go go go there’s no stopping me

F7                      Bb          Gm
I’m burning through the sky yeah, two hundred degrees
                    D7              Gm
That’s why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit
     D7                       Gm
I’m travelling at the speed of light
                                        C
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you





[Chorus]

F     Gm  Am Dm                      Gm             C
Don’t stop me now, I’m having such a good time I’m having a ball
F     Gm  Am Dm                        Gm             D7

[Verse 2]

      F                         Am           Dm
I’m a rocket ship on my way to Mars, on a collision course
      Gm              C
I’m a satellite, I’m out of control
       F                      Am             Dm
I’m a sex machine ready to reload, like an atom bomb
         Gm    C     F
About to oh oh oh explode

      F7                 Bb            Gm
I’m burning through the sky yeah, two hundred degrees
                 D7              Gm
That’s why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit
     D7                         Gm
I’m travelling at the speed of light
                                     C
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you


[Bridge]

Don’t stop me, don’t stop me, don’t stop me (hey, hey, hey)
Don’t stop me, don’t stop me (oo, oo, oo)
Don’t stop me, don’t stop me (have a good time, good time)
