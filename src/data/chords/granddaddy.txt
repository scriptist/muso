     F#m
Grandaddy and I did toil
     E
From morn to sun-down, hands in soil
   D                                      A
We grew those sweet green peas, until our fingers they were raw
 
    F#m
The peas were ripe, the pods they grew
    E
The sweet green peas were all we knew
   D                                                   A
We picked them all with just the two of us down in the fields
 
    F#m
Grandaddy would then grade the peas
    E
And check for those anomalies
        D                               A
If they didn't score an A you see, he'd throw the darn pea out
 
      F#m
There was a special song he'd sing
     E
He'd sing it as he sorted through
     D                                 A
Next time you'll think of him, when we sell our peas to you
 
[Verse]
            E
This is the top of the crop
       D                A
And it wasn't you would blame us
  E
A grade-A pea you see
D              A
We don't serve grade-B or C
B                        E
We'd never stoop down to D
 
                     D
So you can taste the A-ness
                  A
You can taste the A-ness
        E
In your mouth
                  D
You can taste the A-ness
                  A
You can taste the A-ness
 
        E
You can taste the freshness
E
Taste the green-ness
E
Taste the sweetness
E
Really taste the pea-ness
 
                     D
Grandaddy checks the A-ness
                     A
So you can taste the pea-ness
                     E
Grandaddy checks the A-ness
                     A
So you can taste the pea-ness
                     D
Grandaddy checks the A-ness
                     A
So you can taste the pea-ness
 
        E
You can taste the freshness
E
Taste the green-ness
E
Taste the sweetness
E
Really taste the pea-ness

But what of dear old grandmama
     E
The real brains behind the farm
        D                               A
While grandad had grade A for tea he’d fop her off with B or C
    F#m
So late at night she’d sneak around
    E
She’d pick the best peas that she found
     D                                                        A
She had the sweetest peas of all; She played grandaddy for a fool (for a fool, for a fool)
 
 
               D
Grandmama had her-peas
               A
Grandmama had her-peas
        E
In her mouth
               A
Grandmama had her-peas
 
               D
Grandmama had her-peas
              A      E
Grandmama had her-peas
              A
Grandmama had her-peas
