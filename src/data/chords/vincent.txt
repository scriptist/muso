Starry Starry
G                        Am
night paint your pallete blue and grey
              C                 D7                                G
Look out on a summer's day with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
                                       Am
Shadows on a hill sketch the tress and daffodils
                         C               D7                        G
Catch the breeze and the winter chill in colors on the snowy linen land


chorus

C   G
               Am     D7                    G           Em
And now I understand      what you tried to say to me
                         Am7     D7                           Em
How you suffered for you sanity     how you tried to set them free
                              A7          Am7   D7                  G
They would not listen the did not know how   perhaps they'll listen now


Starry starry
G                          Am
night flaming flowers that brightly blaze
                   C              D7                             G
Swirling coulds of violet haze reflect in Vincents eyes of china blue
                                       Am
Colors changing hue, morning fields of amber grays
               C                 D7                                 G
Weatherd faces lined in pain are soothed beneath the artists loving hand


chorus

                  Am7       D7                      G
For the could not love you  but still your love was true
Em          Am7                            Cm6
And when no hope was left in sight on that starry starry night
    G                F7           E7       Am7
You took you life as lovers often do But I could've told you Vincent
     C                                D7           G
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you


Starry starry
G                       Am
night portraits hung in empty halls
                   C                   D7                                     G
frameless heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
                                                      Am
Like the strangers that you've met, the ragged men in ragged clothes
                     C               D7                               G
The silver thorn the bloody rose lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow


chorus

C   G
               Am     D7                    G           Em
And now I understand      what you tried to say to me
                         Am7     D7                           Em
How you suffered for you sanity     How you tried to set them free
                                   A7               Am7   D7              G
They would not listen they're not  listening still     perhaps they never will
