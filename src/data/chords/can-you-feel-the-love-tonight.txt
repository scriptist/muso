[Intro]
| G | D/F# | C/E | G/D | C | G/B | D/F# G | Am7 G/B |
 
[Verse 1]
C              G/B
There's a calm surrender
C              G/B
To the rush of day
C                    G/B
When the heat of the rolling world
Am7            D
Can be turned away
C            G/B
An enchanted moment
C              G/B
And it sees me through
C                    Em
It's enough for this restless warrior
F               D
Just to be with you
 
[Chorus]
    G       D/F#     Em      C
And can you feel the love tonight?
G       C     A/C# D
  It is where we   are
C            G/B         Em   G/D  C
  It's enough   for this wide-eyed wanderer
Am   G  C   A/C# D
That we got this far
    G       D/F#     Em     C
And can you feel the love tonight?
G          C     A/C# D
  How it's laid  to   rest?
C            G/B        Em    G/D C
  It's enough   to make kings and vagabonds
  Am    G   C/D  C/G G
Believe the ve - ry  best
 
[Interlude]
| G | D/F# | C/E | G/D | C | G/B | D/F# G | Am7 G/B |
 
[Verse 2]
C                  G/B
There's a time for everyone
C            G/B
If they only learn
C                   G/B
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Am              D
Moves us all in turn
C                   G/B
There's a rhyme and reason
C              G/B
To the wild outdoors
C                      Em
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
F                  D
Beats in time with yours
 
[Chorus]
    G       D/F#     Em      C
And can you feel the love tonight?
G       C     A/C# D
  It is where we   are
C            G/B         Em   G/D  C
  It's enough   for this wide-eyed wanderer
Am   G  C   A/C# D
That we got this far
    G       D/F#     Em     C
And can you feel the love tonight?
G          C     A/C# D
  How it's laid  to   rest?
C            G/B        Em    G/D C
  It's enough   to make kings and vagabonds
  Am    G   C/D  C/G G
Believe the ve - ry  best
 
[Outro]
C            G/B        Em    G/D C
  It's enough   to make kings and vagabonds
  Am    G   C/D  C/G G
Believe the ve - ry  best
