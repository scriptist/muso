[Verse]
C                 Am
Somewhere deep inside
                  Em          G
Something's got a hold on you
C                    Am
And it's pushing me aside
                     Em      G
See it stretch on forever
 
[Chorus]
               C      C7
And I know I'm right
                      F
For the first time in my life
             G
That's why I tell you
                     C      G
You'd better be home soon
 
[Verse]
C                  Am
Stripping back the coats
              Em       G
Of lies and deception
C              Am
Back to nothingness
                   Em     G
Like a week in the desert
 
[Chorus]
               C      C7
And I know I'm right
                      F
For the first time in my life
             G
That's why I tell you
                     C      C/B
You'd better be home soon
 
 Bb          D                       G
So don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong
 Bb                    A7                D
Cos when you get back home maybe I'll be gone
 
[Instrumental]
C       Am      Em      G
C       Am      Em      F       Bb
 
C                 Am
It would cause me pain
              Em      G
If we were to end it
C                  Am
But I could start again
          Em         G
You can depend on it
 
[Chorus]
              C      C7
And I know I'm right
                        F
For the first time in my life
             G
That's why I tell you
                     C      D7
You'd better be home soon
             F        G
That's why I tell you
                     C
You'd better be home soon
