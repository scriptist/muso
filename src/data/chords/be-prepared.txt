Am      Dm
 
  Am                         Dm
I know that your powers of retention 
       Em                     Am
Are as wet as a warthog's backside.
                           Dm
But thick as you are pay attention
   Em                    Am
My words are a matter of pride.
 
 
     Cm                       Am
It's clear from your vacant expressions,
    Cm                      Am
The lights are not all on upstairs.
    G                           C
But we're talking kings, and successions,
     Bm7b5               E7
Even YOU can't be caught unawares...
 
 
       Am                      Dm
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime,
      G                     C
Be prepared for sensational news...
  Em          Am     Dm         G
A shining new era is tip-toeing nearer
       Em          Am
And where do we feature?
     Dm        G
Just listen to teacher.
 
 
  C
I know it sounds sordid,
    C/Bb
But you'll be rewarded
        A7                 Dm
When at last I am given my dues,
      Bm7b5             E
And injustice, deliciously squared,
Esus E   Am           F
Be   prepared!
 
 
         E7
Yeah, be prepared, heh, heh, 
Am
We'll be prepared, heh.
 
 
For what?
Dm
For the death of the king!
     Em
Why, is he sick?
                      Am
No fools, we're gunna kill him...
 
And Simba too...
 
Great idea, who needs a king?
Dm                            Em
No king, no king, la la la la la la!
                  Am
Idiots! There will be a king!
              Cm
Hey but you said er--
 
 
I WILL BE KING!
Am                 Cm
Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!
Am
Yay, alright! 
G
Yeah,alright!
C
Alright!
 
 
Long live the king,
Bm7b5                    E
Long live the king! 
 
 
     Am                             Dm
It's great that we'll soon be connected
       Em                      Am
With a king who'll be all time adored.
                                     Dm
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected,
   Em                     Am
To take certain duties on board...
 
 
    Cm                      Am
The future is littered with prizes
    Cm                        Am
And though I'm the main addressee,
    G            G7        C
The point that I must emphasize is,
    Bm7b5                  E
YOU WON'T GET A SNIFF WITHOUT ME!
 
 
      Am                       Dm
So prepare for the coup of the century
   G                         C
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
  Em       Am        Dm       G
Meticulous planning, tenacity spanning,
  Em         Am
Decades of denial
   Dm         G
Is simply why I'll 
   C
Be king undisputed,
  C/Bb
respected, saluted,
    A7                    Dm
And seen for the wonder I am.
       Bm7b5                E
Yes my teeth and ambitions are bared.
Esus E  Am
Be   Prepared!
        Bm7b5                E
Yes our teeth and ambitions are bared,
      Am
Be prepared!
