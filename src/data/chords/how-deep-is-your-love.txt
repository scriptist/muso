 [Intro]
D  Dmaj7  Gmaj7  G/A
D  Dmaj7  Gmaj7  G/A
 
[Verse 1]
             D          F#m7    G6
I know your eyes in the morning sun
B7         Em7             F#7      A7
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
        D               F#m7   Bm7
And the moment that you wander far from me
        Em7                   A7
I wanna feel you in my arms again
 
[Bridge]
         Gmaj7           F#m7
Then you come to me on a summer breeze
        Em7                         C9
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
         F#m7               G/A
And it's me you need to show
 
[Chorus]
                D
How deep is your love
                          Dmaj7
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
Gmaj7              Gm6
I really mean to learn
              D                    Am6               B7
'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breaking us down
                            Em7       Gm6            D
When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me
 
[Verse 2]
     F#m7    G6
I believe in you
B7            Em7       F#7   A7
You know the door to my very soul
            D           F#m7    Bm7
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
           Em7             A7
You're my saviour when I fall
        Gmaj7           F#m7
And you may not think I care for you
         Em7                      C9
When you know down inside that I really do
        F#m7             G/A
And it's me you need to show, 
 
[Chorus]
                D
How deep is your love
                          Dmaj7
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
Gmaj7              Gm6
I really mean to learn
              D                    Am6               B7
'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breaking us down
                            Em7       Gm6            D
When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me

I really mean to learn
              D                    Am6               B7
'Cause we're living in a world of fools, breaking us down
                            Em7       Gm6            D
When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me
