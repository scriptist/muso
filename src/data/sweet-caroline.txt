Sweet Caroline chords version 1
Neil Diamond  1969

Capo II

E7 E7\E  E\E7 E E7 A

A              D
Where it began, I can't begin to know it
A                          E
But then I know it's going strong
A                 D
Was it the spring, and spring became a summer?
A                              E    E7
Who'd have believe you'd come along?

A     F#m
Hands,  touching hands
E             D                     E  E\D\E
Reaching out, touching me, touching you

A         D   D\A\D                          E    E\D\E
Sweet Caroline,   good times never seemed so good
A      D    D\A\D                     E
I'm inclined,   to believe they never would
D   C#m Bm
But now I'm

A                 D
Look at the night, and it don't seem so lonely
A                       E
We fill it up with only two
A               D
And when I hurt, hurting runs off my shoulder
A                           E   E7
How can I hurt when holding you?

A    F#m
Warm,  touching warm
E             D                     E  E\D\E
Reaching out, touching me, touching you

A         D   D\A\D                          E    E\D\E
Sweet Caroline,   good times never seemed so good
A      D    D\A\D                     E
I'm inclined,   to believe they never would
D   C#m Bm
Oh  no  no

E7 E7\E  E\E7 E E7 A

A         D   D\A\D                          E    E\D\E
Sweet Caroline,   good times never seemed so good
A      D    D\A\D                     E
I'm inclined,   to believe they never would . . .
