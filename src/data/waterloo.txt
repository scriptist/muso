My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
   D         E/D           A/C# G/B   D/A     A       Bm
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

The history book on the shelf
A  E/G#               A    G  D/F# A/E
Is always repeating itself


D                              G
Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
A                                  D         A A
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more
D                               G

   D         E/D             A/C# G/B       D/A    A      Bm
Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

And how could I ever refuse
A E/G#                   A    G  D/F# A/E
I feel like I win when I lose
